            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>We believe that education matters. We believe education is a basic right of every child. We believe education is the surest way to rise out of poverty.</p>
            <p>We are currently supporting eight educational programs, five in Kenya and three in India. We are looking for new opportunities to grow the number of schools and children we help in both countries. <span class="highlight">World For Everyone Children's Education</span> was established in July of 2017, by Chitra World For Everyone Wright. We are very personally involved in our organization. </p>
            <p>We are all invested financially in our mission and are actually "on the ground" a majority of the time in Africa and India. This is so we are able to know exactly what the most pressing needs are in our schools and ensure that funds are being used wisely.</p>
